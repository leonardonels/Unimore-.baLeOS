The syntax of the chmod command when using numeric method has the following format:

chmod [OPTIONS] NUMBER FILE...

When using the numeric mode, you can set the permissions for all three user classes (owner, group, and all others) at the same time.

The NUMBER can be a 3 or 4-digits number.

When 3 digits number is used, the first digit represents the permissions of the file’s owner, the second one the file’s group, and the last one all other users.

Each write, read, and execute permissions have the following number value:

    r (read) = 4
    w (write) = 2
    x (execute) = 1
    no permissions = 0

The permissions number of a specific user class is represented by the sum of the values of the permissions for that group.

To find out the file’s permissions in numeric mode simply calculate the totals for all users classes. For example, to give read, write and execute
permission to the file’s owner, read and execute permissions to the file’s group and only read permissions to all other users you would do the following:

    Owner: rwx=4+2+1=7
    Group: r-x=4+0+1=5
    Others: r-x=4+0+0=4

Using the method above we come up to the number 754, which represents the desired permissions.

To set up the setuid, setgid, and sticky bit flags use four digits number.

When the 4 digits number is used, the first digit has the following meaning:

    setuid=4
    setgid=2
    sticky=1
    no changes = 0

The next three digits have the same meaning as when using 3 digits number.

If the first digit is 0 it can be omitted, and the mode can be represented with 3 digits. The numeric mode 0755 is the same as 755.

To calculate the numeric mode you can also use another method (binary method), but it is a little more complicated. Knowing how to calculate the
numeric mode using 4, 2, and 1 is sufficient for most users.
